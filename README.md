# AbacusEmbedding_GroupTheory

Final project for MATH598

See main for the code of my initial investigation into Abacus/digit-wise embeddings. The current version uses learned positional weights. This repository does not contain the bulk of the project, only the first snippet of work done. See workingReport.md for my individual initial project update.
